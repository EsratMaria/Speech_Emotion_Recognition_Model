# Speech Emotion Detection Classifier

Emotion recognition is the part of speech recognition which is gaining more popularity and need for it increases enormously. In this repo, I attempt to use deep learning to recognize the emotions from data.

## Dataset
- Crowd-sourced Emotional Mutimodal Actors Dataset (Crema-D)

## How it works
I use this dataframe of extracted features to train the model later.
